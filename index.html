    <h1 class="titlebackground">My basic information</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Edy Donose, I am 15 years old and in grade 10. <br />
      Com Sci has been something that i have been intrested in for a long time.
      I tried self learning a couple times but it didnt really work our very
      well. One main thing that has always been on my mind is a top down horror
      game, I'm hoping that i will get a chance to try making it this semester.

    <h1 class="INEEDACLASS">My view on the class thus far</h1>
    <p>
      The class is pretty cool so far, it is a bit boring at times as i wait for
      the teacher to move on but i suspect that soon we will be working
      independantly
